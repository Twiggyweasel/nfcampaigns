        <h3>What is Neurofibromatosis (NF):</h3>

        <p>
          Neurofibromatosis (NF) is a genetic disorder of the nervous system which causes tumors to form on the nerves anywhere in the body at any time. 
          This progressive disorder affects all races, all ethnic groups and both sexes equally. NF is one of the most common genetic disorders in the 
          United States (one in every 2,500 to 3,000 births). The neurofibromatoses affects more than 100,000 Americans; this makes NF more prevalent 
          than Cystic Fibrosis, hereditary Muscular Dystrophy, Huntington’s Disease and Tay Sachs combined.
          <br />
          <br />
          NF has three genetically distinct forms: NF-1, NF-2 and Schwannomatosis. They are caused by different genes and chromosomes. 
          The effects of NF are unpredictable and have varying manifestations and degrees of severity. 
          There is no known cure for any form of NF, although the genes for both NF-1 and NF-2 have been identified.
          <br />
          <br />
          NF is an autosomal dominant genetic condition; it is not contagious. 
          Approximately 50% of those affected with Neurofibromatosis have a prior family history of NF. 
          The other 50% of cases are the result of spontaneous genetic mutation

        <p>
          Neurofibromatosis Network was founded in 1988 as a 501(c)3 non-profit organization to join together several 
          independent state and regional NF groups wishing to work together on national projects.

              The Mission of the NF Network is to find treatments and a cure for neurofibromatosis by 
              promoting scientific research, improving clinical care, providing outreach through education 
              and awareness, while offering hope and support to those affected by NF.</em>

            <li>Promoting federal funding of neurofibromatosis research through the development of a grassroots advocacy program</li>
            <li>Working closely with members of the House and Senate to seek increased funding for research through the National 
            Institutes of Health (NIH) and the Department of Defense Congressionally Directed Medical Research Program (CDMRP)</li>
            <li>Publishing Network Edge which highlights medical and research updates</li>
            <li>Investing in the financial and promotional support of NF research</li>
            <li>Supporting Camp New Friends, an annual NF children’s camp</li>
            <li>Sponsoring educational programs for families affected by NF</li>
            <li>Maintaining a Find A Doctor national referral database</li>
